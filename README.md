## Overview

This project is a CRUD application developed with React.js that incorporates Google authentication through Auth0. Additionally, it includes a to-do list application with cache storage, allowing for an optimized user experience without constant internet dependency.

The main goal of this development is to strengthen my skills in React.js and the integration of modern authentication systems, as well as improve data management in local storage.
